# Padel-Shot-Classification-and-Dataset
This study is the final proyect of Guillermo Cartes Domínguez, tutored by Daniel Gutiérrez Reina, Alejandro Tapia Córdoba and Evelia Franco Álvarez. 13 different padel shots are recorded in a dataset with more than 2000 shots. A comparison between some of the main machine learning algorithms that aim to classify padel shots is carried out. These algorithms are neural networks, convolutional neural networks 1D, decision tree, K nearest neighbors, and support vector machine.

In order to run each code, you must change the dataset directory in each code to the dataset location on your computer.
